## Project Summary

UIUC students currently have three separate tools to plan their semester plans: course audit to view remaining requirements, course explorer to view prerequisites, and GPA disparity visualizations to gauge difficulty of planned courses. Our project is a web application that allows students to visualize their pending degree requirements, explore options to fulfill them with filters for GPA and their completed prerequisites, and build semester plans that continuously update prerequisite data. When a student adds a course to their plan, the system will automatically recalculate eligibility for dependent courses, flagging ones that cannot yet be taken and showing the earliest semester they become available, so students always know when they can schedule their desired courses.
This platform eliminates the need to interact with all three tools and instead helps students build the best plan to complete their degree requirements. Since it is not feasible to build this application across all majors due to limited data availability, this application will only cover all CS and CS+X majors.
